This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves the Android SDK build tools. The error message might not be very specific, but it generally points to a problem with the build process itself.  It might manifest as a cryptic error message during the build process, a failure to find necessary tools, or a general build failure that doesn't offer obvious clues.  The core issue often stems from inconsistencies or misconfigurations in the Android SDK setup, environment variables, or the project's `gradle` files.
